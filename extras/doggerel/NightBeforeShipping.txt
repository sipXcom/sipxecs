'Twas the Night before shipping
and throughout the source,
no one was coding, 'cept Ranga of course!

The buildbot was compiling
the objects with care.
Tracking the symbols and binaries with flair.

The ISO was finished
'twas time to be shipped.
But Martin decided "Hold on, one more fix!"

So back to the source.
One more line.  One less bug.
"This will really be it", he said with a shrug.

So back to the buildbot
Let it do its thing.
For who knows what riches this release will bring?

--Woof!
