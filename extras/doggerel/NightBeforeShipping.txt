'Twas the Night before shipping
and throughout the source,
no one was coding, 'cept Ranga of course!

The buildbot was compiling
the objects with care.
Tracking the symbols and binaries with flair.

But alas that was not to be
For bad code it had found you see
That brought it to its knees.

Scott broke the build in his usual style.
He had thrown in in a  rather large pile
Of un-adulterated Perl.

The ISO was finished
'twas time to be shipped.
But Martin decided "Hold on, one more fix!"
While slipping a sea monster into the mix.

One more line.  One less bug.
"This will really be it", he said with a shrug.
But he never did see the well hidden bug
Or the monster that lurked below.

So back to the buildbot
Let it do its thing.
For who knows what riches this release will bring?


--Woof!
