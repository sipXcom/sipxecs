Why Ranga never graduated (or here is what he was writing when he should have been working on his thesis):

Why said I,
with a twinkle in my eye,
You get into your T(o)uring machine,
And with a smash,
You press on the gas,
And from city to city you will go.

But remember honey,
To spend little money,
For I don't think it is funny,
If you should come back broke.

Cause I need as much of your bread,
As is possible I said,
So go find the minimum tour.

So she's still a' trying 
I'll probably be dying
Of laughter or I will get old.
For the secret you see 
Is P is not NP 
And she will be T(o)uring for ever more.

Ranga.
