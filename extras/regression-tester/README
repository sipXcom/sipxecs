What is this?
This is a regression test tool for sipx.

How this works:

This tool aims to emulated the endpoints under test. It works by record
and replay.  It uses merged.xml to generate the playback.  It takes as
input a file containing the endpoints and the merged.xml file generated
by sipx-trace.  It uses these inputs to figure out the client and server
transactions in that file and generates the same stimulus through
external emulated user agents. You have to configure the system with
these test user agents. For example, if you wanted to construct a test
where two phones register with the sipx registrar and call each other,
you would proceed as follows.

Example:

1. Run the test on a system where you would like to gather trace.
2. Filter the trace using sipx-trace. The merged.xml file thus obtained can have a superset of information.
3. Copy the merged.xml of interest in the directory testcase/var/log/sipxpbx
4. Copy the validusers.xml file corresponding to merted.xml in the directory testcase/etc/sipxpbx/validusers.xml
5. Copy the domain-config file from the system from where the trace has been obtained to testcase/etc/sipxpbx/domain-config
5. Construct a file that defines the endpoints of interest. Plase this in testcase/sut-config.xml
6. Run the tester on the system under regression test.  You would provide the testcase directory as input to the tester.

This will result in the call flow in testcase/var/log/sipxpbx/merged.xml
being emulated on the system under test.

THIS TOOL IS IN AN EARLY STATE OF COMPLETION. IT IS SUBMITTED TO THE REPOSITORY FOR EARLY COMMENTS.
