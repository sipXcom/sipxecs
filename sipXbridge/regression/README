To run the tests
================
Edit tester.properties and put your IP address there. See tester.properties.example

The make target is "regression"

Make, install and configure sipx. 
You do not need to configure any trunks.  
Just run sipxecs-setup and optinally turn off STUN (because it is a pain).

Sipx need not be running when you run the regression tests.

From the BUILD/sipXbridge/regression directory

you can run the Make target 'regression'.  This will execute the regression test cases.
