(a) (b) Result \
1 1 Send out-of-band 2833; if that is not acceptable, fall back to in-band. \
1 0 Send out-of-band 2833; if that is not acceptable, fall back to INFO . \
0 1 Send in-band DTMF. \
0 0 Send out-of-band INFO. \
In-band means the application will encode the DTMF signals in the audio stream as regular sound. Typically, DTMF is not sent in band, and is only used in specific situations

calls.dtmf.rtp\:2833\:hold_over_time_in_ms.label=Hold over time
calls.dtmf.rtp\:2833\:hold_over_time_in_ms.description=If Force send in band is No and RTP 2833 enabled is true, specifies the minimum length of time for which to send 2833 packets (in milliseconds). This setting is useful in case the user presses a key really fast, to make sure the packet time is longer than that key press.

calls.dtmf.rtp\:2833\:packet_time_in_ms.label=Packet time
calls.dtmf.rtp\:2833\:packet_time_in_ms.description=If Force send in band is No and RTP 2833 enabled is true, specifies the time between 2833 packets (in milliseconds). During this time, only audio will be sent. This setting is useful if you cannot handled back-to-back 2833 packets.

calls.dtmf.feature\:dtmf_strategy\:dtmf_inband.description=True means to send DTMF inband. \
You can set multiple DTMF methods by setting this setting, dtmf_outofband, and dtmf_sip_info. \
Set at least one of these three settings to true. Valid combinations are Outofband true; Outofband and SIP Info true; \
Inband true; Inband and SIP Info true; SIP info true. Do not set both Inband and Outofband to true; \
if you do, the inband setting will be ignored. If you set all three settings to 0, DTMF will not be sent at all.
calls.dtmf.feature\:dtmf_strategy\:dtmf_outofband.label=Outofband
calls.dtmf.feature\:dtmf_strategy\:dtmf_outofband.description=True means to send DTMF out of band, as per RFC 2833. See feature:dtmf_strategy:dtmf_inband for more \
information.

calls.dtmf.system\:dtmf\:force_send_in_band.label=Force send in band
calls.dtmf.system\:dtmf\:force_send_in_band.description=Set as described in RTP 2833 enabled. \
One scenario in which it might be advisable to send in band is if you own your gateways, and\: \
- One or more of these gateways does not support 2833 or does not handle it well. \
- Your gateway is using codecs that reproduce DTMF tones well. \
In this case, setting this setting to true will ensure that DTMF tones get through (because the DTMF tones will bypass the gateway) and that they reproduce accurately at the receiving end. \
Another scenario is\: \
- One or more of these gateways does not support 2833 or does not handle it well. \
- Your gateway is using codecs that do not reproduce DTMF tones well (because they are designed to handle human voice rather than artificial sounds). \
In this scenario, setting this setting to true will not help ensure DTMF tones get through. There is in fact no solution to this scenario.

network.rtp_inactivity.rtp\:inactivity\:rtcp_timer_in_ms.description=Amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait after the last message received before hanging up on an inactive RTP session. \
This setting is read only when Timer enabled is true and only when the application detects that the other party is sending RTCP reports. (When the application determines that reports are not being sent, it uses RTP timer instead.)

network.rtp_inactivity.rtp\:inactivity\:rtp_timer_in_ms.label=RTP timer
network.rtp_inactivity.rtp\:inactivity\:rtp_timer_in_ms.description=Amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait after the last message received before hanging up on an inactive RTP session. \
This setting is read only when Timer enabled is true and only when the application detects that the other party is not sending RTCP reports. (When the application determines that reports are being sent, it uses rtcp_timer_in_ms instead.) The default of 0 means that the call is never hung up. Because RTCP reports are not being received, it is difficult to determine whether the call is legitimately inactive (for example, on hold) or whether it has failed and should be hung up, so the default is to never hang up.

network.rtp_inactivity.rtp\:inactivity\:timer_enabled.label=RTP Timer enabled
network.rtp_inactivity.rtp\:inactivity\:timer_enabled.description=Set to true to instruct the application to hangup when it detects that the RTP session is inactive.

network.stun.system\:stun\:fw_type_expiry_in_seconds.label=Firewall type expiry
network.stun.system\:stun\:fw_type_expiry_in_seconds.description=Expiry for the cache of the firewall type (in seconds). The type is cached so that the application does not have to discover the firewall type each time the network is accessed. Caching is performed because firewall type discovery is expensive. \
the application performs a firewall type discovery only when this timeout expires.

network.stun.system\:stun\:initial_retransmit_time_ms.label=Initial retransmit time
network.stun.system\:stun\:initial_retransmit_time_ms.description=The minimum wait time after the first STUN request (in milliseconds). \
If no reply is received to the first STUN request, the application waits this amount of time, then sends another request. If the second request fails, the application waits twice this time and tries again, then four times this time, and so on, until max_retransmit_time_ms is reached. It then continues retrying at the maximum timeout until a reply succeeds or the maximum requests (specified in total_retransmit_packets) is reached.

network.stun.system\:stun\:max_retransmit_time_ms.label=Maximum retransmit time
network.stun.system\:stun\:max_retransmit_time_ms.description=The maximum wait time between STUN requests (in milliseconds). Once this maximum is reached, the application will wait this time for subsequent attempts, until the maximum retries (specified in Total retransmit packets) is reached.

If setting is true and the application computer has a high bandwidth network connection, then the application will choose CIF resolution. \
If this setting is true and the computer has a low bandwidth connection, then the application will probably choose QCIF.

codecs.general_settings.system\:network\:honor_first_codec.label=Honor first codec
codecs.general_settings.system\:network\:honor_first_codec.description=Controls the codec the application will use for outgoing audio or video (audio or video being sent to the other party). \
- Set to true to instruct the application to respect the other party's preferred codec (as advertised in their SDP). \
- Set to false to instruct the application to ignore the other party's preferred codec (as advertised in their SDP), and to send audio or video in the codec that sounds best, based on the other party's capability, the available bandwidth, and network conditions.

- Bandwidth has been reserved (setting system\:qos\:audio) \
- The computer has a VPN connection to a remote server. \
When these three conditions exist, entering the VPN connection name in this field ensures that the bandwidth reservation and quality of service requests are honored. \
If the setting is not completed, then whenever a phone call is placed while the application computer has a live VPN connection, then the bandwidth reservation and quality of service requests will not be honored. \
If the application is being used in a deployment in which some users are using the specified laptop and other users are using other computers, complete this setting\: its value will be ignored for users with "other" computers. \
The VPN name can be obtained by entering an ipconfig command.

The user can enter text in the filter field on the Directory tab and click Search: Bria does a fresh retrieve from the database, \
this time returning only results that match the filter, but again restricted by the number in the sizelimit setting. \
If the user changes the filter and clicks Search, a fresh retrieve is performed. \
- Fetch and Filter: This method is recommended only if your directory contains fewer than 300 records. \
The Bria directory tab is populated as soon as Bria is started. The retrieve is restricted by the number in the sizelimit \
setting and by the time limit specified in the polltime setting. \

directory.ldap.server_settings.feature\:ldap\:enable.label=Enable
directory.ldap.server_settings.feature\:ldap\:enable.description=Set to true to show the Directory tab next to the Contacts tab and History tab. \
Set to false to hide this tab, which effectively removes support for the directory feature. \
Note that setting to false does not remove the Directory panel from the Preferences window. \
Make sure to enable the directory only for LDAP (this setting) or ADSI (feature:adsi:enable), not for both!
directory.ldap.server_settings.feature\:ldap\:server.label=Server
directory.ldap.server_settings.feature\:ldap\:server.description=The URL of the LDAP server.
directory.ldap.server_settings.feature\:ldap\:auth_method.label=Authentication
directory.ldap.server_settings.feature\:ldap\:auth_method.description=The authentication method for connecting to the LDAP server: \
0: Anonymous \
1: SimpleAuth
directory.ldap.server_settings.feature\:ldap\:username.label=Username
directory.ldap.server_settings.feature\:ldap\:username.description=The username for connecting to the LDAP server.

directory.ldap.server_settings.feature\:ldap\:password.description=The password for connecting to the LDAP server.
directory.ldap.server_settings.feature\:ldap\:root.label=Root DN
directory.ldap.server_settings.feature\:ldap\:root.description=The LDAP root; must be the full DN.
directory.ldap.server_settings.feature\:ldap\:query.label=Search Expression
directory.ldap.server_settings.feature\:ldap\:query.description=A string that identifies the objects to retrieve from the directory. \
For example, the string might restrict retrieval to users and contacts and omit computers, printers and other objects.
directory.ldap.search_options.label=Search Options
directory.ldap.search_options.feature\:ldap\:search_on_demand.label=Search type
directory.ldap.search_options.feature\:ldap\:search_on_demand.description=Enter 1 to perform an on-demand search or 0 to perform a fetch-and-filter search: \
- On demand: The Bria directory tab is empty until the user performs a search. Bria will only fetch data from the external directory when the user \
clicks the Search button. The number of entries returned is restricted by the number in the sizelimit setting. \ 
The user can enter text in the filter field on the Directory tab and click Search: Bria does a fresh retrieve from the database, \
this time returning only results that match the filter, but again restricted by the number in the sizelimit setting. If the user changes the filter and clicks Search, a fresh retrieve is performed.
- Fetch and Filter: This method is recommended only if your directory contains fewer than 300 records. The Bria directory tab is populated as soon as Bria is started. \
The retrieve is restricted by the number in the sizelimit setting and by the time limit specified in the polltime setting. \
With this method, there is no Search button on the directory tab. When the user enters text in the filter field, \
the current results are filtered; a retrieve from the database is not performed.
directory.ldap.search_options.feature\:ldap\:timeout.label=Search timeout
directory.ldap.search_options.feature\:ldap\:timeout.description=The timeout, in milliseconds, for any single search transation, \
from the time the transaction is requested. If this timeout expires, Bria drops any records that have not yet been delivered. \
This timeout is a suggestion for the external directory; the directory may ignore this limit.
directory.ldap.search_options.feature\:ldap\:sizelimit.label=Max results
directory.ldap.search_options.feature\:ldap\:sizelimit.description=The maximum number of records to retrieve. \
This number is sent to the external directory in a transaction request, as a suggestion for the server; the server may ignore this limit.
directory.ldap.search_options.feature\:ldap\:polltime.label=Update interval
directory.ldap.search_options.feature\:ldap\:polltime.description=The update interval, in seconds, when the mode is Fetch-and-filter \
(feature:ldap:search_on_demand is false). Specifies the expiry time for the retrieval. \
When the polltime expires, the retrieval is performed again, the directory is refreshed, and then the user's current filter (if any) \
is automatically applied. In other words, the filter is not cleared.
directory.ldap.attribute_mapping.label=Attribute Mapping
directory.ldap.attribute_mapping.description=Each "key" setting specifies the attribute in the external directory \
that is considered to be a specific field in the Bria directory. Data from a specific attribute in the external directory will be mapped \
to a specific field in the directory in Bria.
