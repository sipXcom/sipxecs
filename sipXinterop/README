Interoperability Test Configuration

This subproject creates a special interoperability test configuration for a sipXecs system. 
It may be used on a system installed from source, or one installed from rpms.

To install this configuration on a system that already has sipXecs installed:

1) If the system was installed from RPMs, obtain and configure the sipXinterop sources; 
   (if the system was installed from source, this has already been done - skip this step): 

   a) Check out the project source tree on the target system.

   b) Create the autoconf template files as usual in the top level of the source tree:

        autoreconf -if

   c) Run the configure script to match the existing installation:

        ./configure $(sipxportlib-config --configopts)

      Or, if you prefer a build directory separate from the source tree:

        cd <your-build-dir>

        <relative-path-to-source>/configure $(sipxportlib-config --configopts)

2) Run make in the build directory for this project:

   make all install

3) As root, run the installation script to install the configuration:

   sipxinterop-setup
