# wouldn't be obvious to admin/system and therefore easily fixed in
# the application layer, or recreate itself eventually like phone

Usage: mongodb [options]

Repairs a corrupt mongodb data store.

Options:

  --auto - Will only repair db if it detects mongod died unexpectingly.  Safe to run this 
           in a cron.  This will restart mongod if it does repair database. 

  --obliterate 
           Completely wipe mongo db clean.  Will attempt to stop server before dropping db, 
           and start server after creating a new database. Only run this if you're sure
	   you know what you're doing.
