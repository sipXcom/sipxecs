To (re-)set-up a sipX system for a particular host name and IP address:

1. The host's name does not need to match the SIP domain, as long as
the RFC 3263 process resolves the SIP domain to the host's IP address.

2. If you put the host's name in /etc/hosts as a name for 127.0.0.1
(which allows your host to know its name even if its network
connection is down), put your host's preferred FQDN as the *first*
hostname in the line for 127.0.0.1.  Otherwise, sipxecs-setup's
getfqdn() will decide that your host is "localhost.localdomain".

3. Delete etc/sipxpbx/ssl, to prepare for installing new certificates.

4. Run bin/sipxecs-setup (does not need to run as root, but must be
run from a screen terminal).  Give it the correct SIP domain name.

5. Set SIP_DOMAIN_NAME, SIP_REALM, and CONFIG_HOSTS in
etc/sipxpbx/domain-config.  *Note that the realm must match the realm
used in the user credentials currently in the config database or else
the users' passwords must be reentered via the GUI.

6. Add all of the host's IP addreses to this Allow command:

    etc/sipxpbx/httpd-sipxchange-common.conf.in

    # protect the sipxchange cgi-bin directory from unauthorized access
    <Directory "/home/dworley/sandbox-147/sipX/../dir-local/share/www/cgi-bin">
        # Standard directory settings taken from httpd.conf
        #AllowOverride All  # Commented out by Mike M.
        Order Deny,Allow
        Deny from all
>>>>    Allow from 127.0.0.1 47.16.90.165 %FULLY_QUALIFIED_HOSTNAME%
        Satisfy any
    </Directory>

5. Delete the contents of var/log/sipxpbx so you can easily see the
post-revision messages.

6. If DNS for the chosen SIP domain does not resolve to the IP address
of the host, comment out these lines in bin/sipXproxy.sh, which are a
startup test for that problem:

    if false; then   # <--- Add this line
	 if [ ${proxy_config_status} -eq 0 ]
	 then
	     myIp=`sipx_config_value /home/dworley/sandbox-147/sipX/../dir-local/etc/sipxpbx/sipXproxy-config SIPX_PROXY_BIND_IP 2> /dev/null`
	     if ! sip_resolves_to ${myDomain} ${myIp}
	     then
		 cat <<ERROR
	SIP route to SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME '${myDomain}' is not to my IP address: ${myIp}
	See the installation guide on setting the DNS SRV records and domain names
    ERROR
		 Status=1
	     fi
	 fi
    fi    # <--- Add this line

7. Do the first-run processing by executing "bin/sipxconfig.sh --first-run".

8. Clear the superadmin password by executing "bin/sipxconfig.sh
--database reset-superadmin".  (Necessary if the SIP realm has
changed.)

9. Run "etc/init.d/sipxecs start" (as root) to start sipX.

10. Log into the web UI.

11. Go to the Servers page, set up one server, the host, with its IP
address.  Send profiles to it.  Restart all services.  Note: Do *not*
stop all services and then start all services, as that will stop
sipXconfig.  (See XCF-3591.)
